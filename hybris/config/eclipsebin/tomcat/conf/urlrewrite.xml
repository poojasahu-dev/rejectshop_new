		<note>
			The outbound-rule specifies that when response.encodeURL is called (if
			you are using JSTL c:url) the url /rewrite-status will be rewritten
			to /test/status/. The above rule and this outbound-rule means that
			end users should never see the url /rewrite-status only /test/status/
			both in thier location bar and in hyperlinks in your pages.
