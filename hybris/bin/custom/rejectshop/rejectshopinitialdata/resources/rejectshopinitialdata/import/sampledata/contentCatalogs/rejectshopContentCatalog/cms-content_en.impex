;;faqaccordion1;The Reject Shop is a funny name. Is the stock faulty?;"No. Our first store opened in South Yarra, Victoria in 1981. This 
shop sold 'seconds' and discontinued lines, hence The Reject Shop name. Today however, we no longer just sell seconds and discontinued lines, 
and have adopted our current formula for low prices and bargains on the everyday things people use most in their life."
;;faqaccordion2;I've seen a 'Parallel Import' symbol on some items in your catalogues, what does this mean?;"This is the genuine, branded article 
but it may differ in design, materials and formulation from similar products offered locally. It does not have the support of the official Australian 
distributor, but The Reject Shop supports these products with its normal trading warranty."
;;faqaccordion3;If my purchase is damaged or faulty, what is The Reject Shop's returns policy?;"We offer a full money back guarantee 
on all purchases if the product is faulty, simply return it with the receipt to the store you bought it from for a refund."
;;faqaccordion4;Do you give cash out at your stores?;"You can get cash out at any register when paying for your purchase with EFTPOS."
;;faqaccordion5;What is the acceptable method of payments in stores?;"The accepted methods of payment at The Reject Shop is cash, 
visa, mastercard and bank transaction card. Please note that we do not accept cheque payments."
;;faqaccordion6;Are any of the stores franchised?;No, all stores are 100% company owned.
;;faqaccordion7;How many people does The Reject Shop employ?;"The Reject Shop employs about 550 full time staff and about 1800 casual staff. 
During the busy Christmas trading season, several hundred more casual staff are employed."
;;faqaccordion8;I'm looking for work with a vibrant retailer. How can I apply for a job at The Reject Shop?;"For Shop Assistant roles, 
the best way to apply is to visit a store and ask the Store Manager. Stores are responsible for hiring their own team members. 
If you are looking for a management role please email a copy of your resume to <a href=""mailto:recruitmentmanager@rejectshop.com.au""><u>
recruitmentmanager@rejectshop.com.au</u></a>"
;;faqaccordion9;How do I become a supplier to The Reject Shop?;"Phone our buying office on (03) 9371 5555 and ask to speak to the relevant buyer. You can also read the <a href=""/aboutus/informationforsuppliers"">Information for Suppliers</a> page on this website."
;;faqaccordion10;I am already a supplier. How do I organise a delivery to the Distribution Centre?;"Our DC is located at 120 Link Road,
Melbourne Airport, VIC 3045. You will need to book your delivery 48 hours in advance by phoning our receiving department on (03) 9933 5852. 
Please have the order number and estimated number of pallets in the delivery available when you phone us. Finally, when making the delivery, 
please ensure that all paperwork accompanies the goods."
;;faqaccordion11;I am already a supplier. How do I organize a direct delivery to the Stores?;"Some store direct orders are required to be 
delivered to our DC however most deliveries can be made directly to the store without any prior contact. Store contacts are available on 
this Internet site if required. Please note that some stores have delivery curfew times. Please contact the appropriate buyer if you are 
unsure of your required delivery point or time."
;;faqaccordion12;Why does The Reject Shop not display all products on the website?;"The Reject Shop is a variety store with a constantly changing product offer, therefore quite often our stocks are limited and available for a short period of time. As such, The Reject Shop do not display all products on the website."
;;faqaccordion13;Will The Reject Shop sell online?;"The Reject Shop understands the growth of online shopping, however the business' current focus is opening up new stores throughout Australia."
